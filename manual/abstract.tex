DDEBIFTOOL is a collection of Matlab routines for
numerical bifurcation analysis of systems of delay differential
equations with discrete constant and state-dependent delays.

The package supports continuation and stability analysis of steady
state solutions and periodic solutions.  Further one can compute and
continue several local and global bifurcations: fold and Hopf
bifurcations of steady states; folds, period doublings and torus
bifurcations of periodic orbits; and
connecting orbits between equilibria.

To analyse the stability of steady state solutions, approximations are
computed to the rightmost, stability-determining roots of the
characteristic equation which can subsequently be used as starting
values in a Newton procedure.

For periodic solutions, approximations to the Floquet multipliers are
computed.  The manual describes the structure of the package, its routines, and
its data and method parameter structures.
